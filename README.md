# FriendFinder

This is an application that was created to help people who are looking for friends. If you're new to the area or your just trying to find some new people to hang out with, this is the app for you! Each person on this site has to answer a survey of questions which will determine what type of friend you are. Once you submit your survey questions, the app will find you a friend that closest matches your survey answers.
